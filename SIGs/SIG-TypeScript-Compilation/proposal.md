# Proposal to Create SIG-TypeScript-Compilation

This document is a proposal to create SIG-TypeScript-Compilation as a formal Special Interest Group (SIG) under the auspices of the TSC of the Bytecode Alliance, as specified in the TSCâ€™s charter. 

SIG-TypeScript-Compilation's primary goal is to describe and refine a suitable solution for compiling TypeScript program to WebAssembly based on the Wasm GC proposal and executing it in both browser and standalone Wasm runtime. The scope of this SIG is limited to discussions about compiling TS to WebAssembly, the neccessary runtime API (potentially defined as WASI) for supporting TS language features such as `Any` type, and exploration of how WebAssembly can grow to provide better support of dynamic languages natively.

While it is not an express goal of the group, it is understood that in the process of designing, the group will produce proof-of-concept code.   

As deliverables of the SIG, the group will produce Notes describing the scope of supported TS language features, the compilation methods, the runtime API defintions, and new proposals for WebAssembly or WASI spec. Should the TSC accept these Notes, the SIG will refine them into a position or recommendation. 

Should the code artifacts prove generally useful, the SIG may also approach the TSC about turning one or more of these efforts into a Core or At Large Project. As part of this process, the SIG will delegate some or all of its participants as maintainers of any code that will continue development after the SIG is complete.
